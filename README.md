# MCTopAligningLabel

Goal of this project is to extend UILabel so that it would align text at the top of the element instead of the center. 

## Installation

Copy files from the "Classes" folder into your project.

## Usage

Use just as you would use the standard UILabel component. Width of the component will be the same as the original UILabel, height will adjust depending on the content and settings so that text starts at the top of the element.
